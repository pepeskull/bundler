# Solana Bundle Buy (Wallet Bundler)

A web-based tool that lets you **execute multiple Solana swaps in a controlled bundle**, using multiple wallets, with **drag‑and‑drop execution order**, live quotes via **Jupiter**, and a **clear execution modal**.

This project is designed for power users who want to:

* Buy the same token from **multiple wallets**
* Control **execution order** (stack order → active wallet last)
* Avoid RPC overload with **staggered execution**
* See **real transaction status** instead of silent failures

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔐 **Client‑side key handling** (keys are never stored or sent elsewhere)
* 🧩 **Active wallet + stack wallets UI**
* ☰ **Drag‑and‑drop stack ordering** (handle-only dragging)
* 📊 **Live SOL balance + Jupiter quotes**
* 🧮 **Automatic total SOL calculation**
* 🚀 **Staggered execution** (RPC‑safe)
* 📋 **Execution modal with per‑wallet status**
* 🔗 **Solscan links on success**

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### Frontend

* Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* No framework dependencies
* Uses:

  * `@solana/web3.js` (browser build)
  * `tweetnacl` for key handling
  * `SortableJS` for drag ordering

### Backend (API routes)

* Deployed on **Vercel**
* Acts as a **transaction relay only**
* Never receives private keys

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Set these in Vercel (or your local environment):

```bash
SOLANA_RPC=https://your.rpc.endpoint
SOLANATRACKER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

---

## 🖥️ How It Works

### 1. Add wallets

* One wallet is active by default
* Add up to **16 wallets total**
* Stack wallets appear on the right

### 2. Drag to reorder

* Drag using the ☰ handle only
* Empty slots stay fixed at the bottom
* **Execution order = stack order + active wallet last**

### 3. Enter token mint

* Token metadata fetched automatically
* Logo + symbol displayed
* Token decimals cached for quotes

### 4. Enter SOL amount

* Balance shown per wallet
* Quote fetched from Jupiter
* Total SOL calculated live

### 5. Buy Bundle

* Execution modal always opens
* Wallets execute **sequentially** (300ms spacing)
* Status updates in real time

---

## 🔁 Execution Logic

* Wallets without a valid key or SOL amount are skipped
* Transactions are **staggered** to prevent RPC failures
* Some RPCs may report `simulation failed` even if the transaction lands
* UI treats ambiguous RPC errors as **Pending**, not Failed

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

* ❗ Private keys are **never stored**
* ❗ Private keys are **never sent to the backend**
* Signing happens **locally in the browser**
* Backend only receives a **signed, serialized transaction**

---

## 🧪 Known RPC Behavior

You may see logs like:

```
Simulation failed: insufficient lamports
```

Even when:

* The transaction succeeds
* Tokens arrive in the wallet

This is a known Solana RPC edge case. The UI is designed to handle this safely.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

* No Phantom / wallet adapter support (by design)
* No transaction batching (sequential only)
* Requires sufficient SOL for ATA creation + fees

---

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
npm install
vercel dev
```

## ❤️ Notes

This project intentionally avoids heavy frameworks to keep:

* Key handling transparent
* Execution predictable
* Debugging straightforward

If you know what you’re doing on Solana — this tool is built for you.
